CURRENT
+++++++

1. add ability to fetch every task parameter(attribute) via cli arguments [DONE]
2. add more colors
3. add a Goal class - new functionality
4. add a new Database for long term Goals


=======
1. Print statements are not probably the cleanest way , especially when within
a class, a class should only provide the logical framework, not the TUI or error
log direct-print statements , something else should be done in its place

2. clean up the code a bit more. the TaskManager class may need more
scalability in the future

=============== FUTURE ROADMAP ==============================================

1. Graphs. DSA. DBMS, move away from JSON.

2. Saving the entire task list each time now. impractical, again its a DBMS
thing.

3. Reliability

4. Cross-platform Compatibility

5. Cross-platform Cloud - hosting storage might be tricky.

6. after DSA - custom AI.

7. after necessary AI, custom GUI

8. Custom CLI parser, argparse != git level parsing
